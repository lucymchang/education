## Introduction to R

Originally developed for a 1.5 hour classroom lecture for a course in which students conducted independent research projects within natural history collections (https://bnhm.berkeley.edu/)

**Intended audience:**
* Undergraduate students conducting independent research with zero programming experience

**Outcomes:**
* Material was covered in the allotted time without needing to heavily monitor pacing
* Many students successfully implemented analyses and data visualization in R for their final projects

**Notes:**
* Prioritized using a blackboard to illustrate new or difficult concepts such as variable assignment and dimensionality - do not touch R until concepts are clear
* Students had opportunities to ask more questions during office hours the 2-3 weeks following this lecture before final projects were presented
